Modeled by the #GiveHealthy Movement, the virtual food drive provides an alternative to traditional in-person food drives that are limited to non-perishable donations. The drive allows individuals to select items from a curated list of healthy foods created by various hunger organizations. These items are purchased online and delivered directly to organizations once the drive is complete.\n\nThe food drive will conclude on Oct. 28, during UMD's homecoming game against Indiana University. The community can also make in-person food donations from 12:30-3:30 p.m. at Riggs Alumni Center. \n\nVirtual food drive donations can be made by visiting go.umd.edu/Virtual-Food-Drive.","cost":"","xproperties":[{"X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS":{"values":{"text":"/user/agrp_calsuite-MainCampus/Ongoing"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS":{"values":{"text":"/user/agrp_calsuite-MainCampus/Audience/Parents"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS":{"values":{"text":"/user/agrp_calsuite-MainCampus/Audience/Prospective Students"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS":{"values":{"text":"/user/agrp_calsuite-MainCampus/Audience/Students"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS":{"values":{"text":"/user/agrp_calsuite-MainCampus/Audience/Open to Public"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS":{"values":{"text":"/user/agrp_calsuite-MainCampus/Audience/Faculty and Staff"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS":{"values":{"text":"/user/agrp_calsuite-MainCampus/Audience/Alumni"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS":{"values":{"text":"/user/agrp_calsuite-MainCampus/Categories/Health and Wellness"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS":{"values":{"text":"/user/agrp_calsuite-MainCampus/Other Tags/Homecoming"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-IMAGE":{"values":{"text":"https://oce.umd.edu/file/umddiscoverstemplateocereviseddogoodumdpng"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-CATEGORIES":{"values":{"text":"#DoGoodUMD"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-SUBMITTER-EMAIL":{"values":{"text":"cmitche9@umd.edu"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-SUBMITTEDBY":{"values":{"text":"cmitche9"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-SUBMIT-COMMENT":{"values":{"text":" #DoGoodUMD"}}}]},{"summary":"Homecoming Service Project","subscriptionId":"","calPath":"%2Fpublic%2Fcals%2FMainCal","guid":"CAL-ff808081-5e3c41a9-015e-3e066b87-00000620demobedework%40mysite.edu","recurrenceId":"","link":"https://go.umd.edu/pq3","eventlink":"http://umd.bwcs-hosting.com/cal/event/eventView.do?calPath=%2Fpublic%2Fcals%2FMainCal&guid=CAL-ff808081-5e3c41a9-015e-3e066b87-00000620demobedework%40mysite.edu&recurrenceId=","status":"CONFIRMED","formattedDate":"Sunday, October 22, 2017 9:00 AM - 9:00 PM","start":{"allday":"false","shortdate":"10/22/17","longdate":"October 22, 2017","dayname":"Sunday","time":"9:00 AM","utcdate":"20171022T130000Z","datetime":"20171022T090000","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"end":{"allday":"false","shortdate":"10/22/17","longdate":"October 22, 2017","dayname":"Sunday","time":"9:00 PM","utcdate":"20171023T010000Z","datetime":"20171022T210000","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"location":{"address":"Ritchie Coliseum","link":""},"contact":{"name":"Terps Against Hunger","phone":"","link":"http://www.terpsagainsthunger.com/"},"calendar":{"name":"MainCal","displayName":"MainCal","path":"/public/cals/MainCal","encodedPath":"%2Fpublic%2Fcals%2FMainCal"},"categories":["Open to Public","Student Life","Family-Friendly","Student Affairs","Parents","Homecoming","Prospective Students","Faculty and Staff","Alumni","Free","Community Engagement"],"description":"UMD student organization Terps Against Hunger, in partnership with the Department of Fraternity and Sorority Life and other student groups,is honored to host its fourth annual UMD Homecoming Community Service Event, bringing together over 3,000 volunteers to package 300,000 meals in a single day.
